        <h1> Mission of CHRF</h1>
            </p> Mission of Child Health Research Foundation is to improve child health in Bangladesh and around the world by 
                facilitating appropriate policy decisions through research and advocacy. </P>
            </P>The idea for setting up CHRF came from the realization of the founding group of researchers that developing countries
                    like Bangladesh often lack the evidence needed for rational and timely policy decisions due to inadequate and improper use
                    of limited resources. Scarcity of evidence, in turn, discourages the investment in child health. CHRF works to make sure that evidence
                    about disease burden and causes is generated through high quality research conducted using limited resources.</p>
            </p>In addition to research, CHRF also works with other non-profit hospitals to facilitate low cost diagnostic services 
            for poor patients to improve child health while simultaneously collective valuable evidence for policy designs. 
            Through an association with the Department of Microbiology at Dhaka Shishu Hospital and through a consortium of urban
             and rural hospitals, CHRF has access to research facilities that enables it to contribute to scientific and medical
            knowledge and their applications in South Asia to improve public health approaches.
